	BLOG v2 Design:
	
	Main GOALS:
	
		1. Make the project as generic as possible. It should be easily re-usable by anyone who needs a similar blog of their own
	
		2. Provide creative freedom to the author. Blog should align text/photos/videos effortlessly
		
		3. Should be compatible to devices of all size
		
		4. Have a clean slate UI version as well as graphic filled version
		
		5. Authentication to be implemented for secure resources

		
		Backend:
		
			1. DB	-	Read and choose an appropriate No SQL DB. [Cassandra/Mongo e.t.c.]
			
			2. Server Cache - Redis
			
			3. Graal VM - Latest Java version to be used
			
			4. Choose between Microprofile and Quarkus
			
		Frontend:
		
			1. Explore and come up with an awesome design
			
			2. Angular latest version
			
		Build and Deployment:
		
			1. Use Gradle for packaging
			
			2. Docker for creating an image
			
			3. Kubernetes for managing
			
	Design Decisions:
	
		1. For Backend, Quarkus along with GraalVM with Java version 1.8 has been chosen.
		
		2. For frontend, Angular 7 will be used.
		
		3. Gradle will be the application packaging tool.
		
		4. Docker to be used for storing and shipping the application package.
		
		5. Github for version control.
		
		6. Travis CI for CI/CD.
		
		7. Freedcamp.com for tracking the changes - Agile. [ https://freedcamp.com/Sleeping8_k4K/BlogAPp_mjV/todos ]
		
		8. Server side cache will be through Redis or should we use Infispan ? :/
		
		9. Search functionality will be through Elasticsearch.
		
		10. RxJava will be used for Async programming.
